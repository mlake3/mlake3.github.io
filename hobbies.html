			<h2>Figure Skating</h2>
			<p>Fun fact: I have been a competitive figure skater for almost my entire life!  
					I began skating when I was just under 2 years old, and entered my first competition
					at age 3.  By the time I was 9, I qualified for my first national championship.  When I was 15,
					I qualified for Team USA and competed at my first international competition in the Netherlands.
			</p>
			<h2>Music</h2>
			<p>Music plays a huge role in my life.  Not only do I skate to music, I also play it!  I started
			playing piano when I was in kindgarten, and while it has been a rocky road, I still enjoy playing to
			this day.  I am particularly interested in playing jazz piano, my favorite artists being Bill Evans, 
			McCoy Tyner, and Oscar Peterson.  I can also play cello and violin, though not nearly as well as I can play
			piano.  Aside from jazz, I love listening to many genres, including classical, rock, indie, hip-hop, rap, 
			R&B, blues, and alternative.</p>
			<h2>Other Sports</h2>
			<p>I am a huge basketball fan!  I watch it almost every day, that is, when there are games actually going on.
			I also love to play golf.</p>
